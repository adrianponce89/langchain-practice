# Lanchain practice

This project requires an OpenAI API key for functionality. 

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file:

  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  ```

3. Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

Please make sure not to commit the `.env` file to version control to avoid exposing your API key.

4. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pipenv install
```

5. Activate the project's virtual environment:
```
pipenv shell
```

## Running the Project
After completing the setup, you can run a project using the following command:
```
python filename.py
```

This will start the application. You can stop it by pressing `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.
