# Lanchain course 1

This project requires an OpenAI API key for functionality. 

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file:

  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  ```

3. Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.

Please make sure not to commit the `.env` file to version control to avoid exposing your API key.
